Overseer
========

**Microservices Status Page. Monitors a distributed infrastructure and sends alerts (Slack, SMS, etc.).**

Overseer is an open-source Status Page thar you can host on your infrastructure, used it to monitor all your servers and apps, and visible to your users (on a domain of your choice, eg. `status.example.com`).

It is useful in microservices contexts to monitor both apps and backends. If a node goes down in your infrastructure, you receive a status change notification in a Slack channel, Email, Twilio SMS or/and XMPP.
